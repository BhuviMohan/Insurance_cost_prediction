# Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates both classification and regression modeling using the Medical Cost Personal Dataset.

## Tasks Performed:
- Classification: Predict if a person’s insurance charges will be high or low
- Regression: Predict the actual insurance charge amount

## Dataset:
- Source: [Kaggle - Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)

## Models Used:
- Logistic Regression (for classification)
- Linear Regression (for regression)

## Results:
- Classification Accuracy: 91%
- Regression R² Score: 0.78

- `Model Building.ipynb`: Complete model notebook
- `Model Building - Final Report.pdf`: Structured report with all details
